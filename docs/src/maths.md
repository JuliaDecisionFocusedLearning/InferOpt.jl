# An introduction to InferOpt.jl

Positioned at the intersection of Machine Learning and Combinatorial Optimization, `InferOpt` background can be presented through two distinct approaches.
Based on your familiarity with either field, you can choose to read one of the two following sections.

## From a machine learning perspective

The goal of InferOpt.jl is to make machine learning pipelines more expressive by incorporating combinatorial optimization layers.
